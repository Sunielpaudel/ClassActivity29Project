# Movie String Parsing Project

A simple C++ utility that parses a movie string (in the format of "Title Season, Year") into structured data, extracting the title, season, and year. This project demonstrates basic string manipulation and modular design in C++, using header (`.hpp`) and source (`.cpp`) files for code organization.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- **Parse Movie Data:** To implement a function that parses a string representing a movie's title, season, and release year.
- **Modular Code Design:** To organize the project into header and source files to promote maintainability and code clarity.
- **Use C++ Standard Library Features:** To demonstrate the use of common C++ features such as `std::string`, `std::stoi`, and `std::ostringstream` for handling strings and converting data types.
- **Efficient Parsing:** To provide an efficient method for extracting information from formatted strings and storing them in a structured `Movie` object.
- **Demonstrate Practical Application:** To show how string parsing can be used in real-world scenarios, such as processing movie metadata or other structured text inputs.

## Features

- Parses movie title, season, and year from a formatted string.
- Uses modular code structure with header (`.hpp`) and source (`.cpp`) files.
- Simple and easy-to-understand string parsing implementation in C++.
- The program demonstrates the use of `std::string`, `std::stoi`, and `std::ostringstream` for handling input and data extraction.
